// When you click the card, the achievement expands. The achievement icon will be in the top left corner overflowing the card and inside the card there will be the title, description, a 5 step component for the progress of the achievement and underneath a list of checks for the unlocked achievements.
// For example, if an achievement is complete every map from x mapper, there'll be a list of each map but with ????????????????? as their names. If the player completes the map, the map name will be revealed and the check icon highlighted.
